# Autonomous General Intelligence (AGI) Solution Generator

This project leverages the OpenAI API to create a script that interacts with a model named `gpt-4o` to generate solutions for user-provided prompts. The script runs interactively, continuously accepting user inputs, processing them through the AI model, and returning the solutions until the user decides to exit.

## Objective

To showcase a recursivce prompt solutions generator as openmind infinite response openai gpt-4o api call

## Script Overview

This Python script allows users to input problem statements, processes these inputs using OpenAI's `gpt-4o` model, and continues to returns the solutions generated by the AI.

### Key Components

**Importing Required Libraries**

```python
import openai
```

This line imports the OpenAI library, which is essential for interacting with OpenAI's API to utilize their AI models

# ADD YOUR API KEY
```python
openai.api_key = ''
```
